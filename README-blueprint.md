## Description

Project description here...

**Project Motivation** - I built this project because I was in need to build an application that allows me to build a README file in a consistent way...
**Project Reason** - I built this project because I did not find another tool that allowed me to fulfill my requirements...
**Problem Addressed** - The project solves the need to build a professional README file in a consistent manner...
**Lessons Learned** - I learnt that coding with Inquirer.js can be challenging, but fun at the same time...
**Project Uniqueness** - This project can be the foundation to building other similar applications that require user input in a consistent way, for example, for creating install applications considering user input with the minimal hardware and software requirements...
